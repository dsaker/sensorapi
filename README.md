# sensorapi
An api for collecting data from greenhouse sensors

For this project I am building sensor network for greenhouses using Wemos D1 Mini Boards and a Raspberry Pi for microcontroller/data collection. I am creating an interface so a user can set alerts that will be sent as text if humidity or temperature reaches a low or high threshold. Later I am planning on adding sitting water, light, and dry soil sensors.
